✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

The are three main projects:

* libs
* multiplayer  (nestjs server)
* tanks ( game client )


## Commands

Start the server
```
nx serve multiplayer
```

Start the client 
``` 
nx build tanks 
npx http-server dist/tanks 
 ```
Build a lib (e.g: collision )
``` 
nx build collision
```

## TODO
Source maps are not correctly propagated between libs and the client app. When the client is served, it's not 
possible to debug properly the typescript source file
